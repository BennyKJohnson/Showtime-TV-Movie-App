# Showtime
CSCI342 Project

## Getting Started 

The project depends on third party libraries to run. For this project we used Carthage to manage these dependencies.
### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Run `carthage update` to build the frameworks

Open the Xcode project and run the project.
